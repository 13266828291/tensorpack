Bug Reports/Feature Requests/Usage Questions Only:

Bug Reports:
Some part of code (either the library or examples) doesn't work as expected.

Feature Requests:
1. Improve an existing feature.
2. Add a new feature. Please note that, you can implement a lot of features by extending tensorpack
	(See http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#extend-tensorpack).
	It may not have to be added to tensorpack unless you have a good reason.
3. Note that we don't take "example requests".

Usage Questions:
Usage questions are like "How do I do [this specific thing] in tensorpack?".
We don't answer general machine learning questions like:
"I want to do [this machine learning task]. What specific things I need to do?"
