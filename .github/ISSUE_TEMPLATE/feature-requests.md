+ You can implement a lot of features by extending Tensorpack
  (See http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#extend-tensorpack).
  It does not have to be added to Tensorpack unless you have a good reason.
+ "Could you improve/implement an example/paper ?" 
  -- The answer is: we have no plans to do so. We don't take feature requests for
  examples or implement a paper for you. If you don't know how to do it, you may ask a usage question.
